        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jared. I was born in Olympia, Washington. I grew up in Olympia and was raised by my mom and dad. I have an older brother and sister. I played football and basketball growing up and I am a huge sports junkie.</p>
        <p>I am a sophomore at University of Washington. My intended major is Business. I've been a UW sports fan my entire life. This Saturday UW is playing Cal and could improve to 6-0 on the season. </p>
